        <p>Arctic foxes are quite literally built for the ice cold, unlike their non-arctic counterparts. Arctic Foxes tend to behave in a solitary manner, rarely associating with those around them. They also behave monogamously, choosing to mate with one partner at a time rather than mating with multiple.</p>
