        <p>Narwhals are the unicorns of the sea, boasting a lengthy tusk upon their heads. Despite what you may think, this tusk that rests upon their faces is actually an enlarged tooth which contains up to 10 million nerve endings. This tusk can grow nearly twice as long as the average human's height, up to 10 feet long!</p>
